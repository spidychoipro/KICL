# KICL (Kpop-Inspired Coding Language)
KICL is a programming language that is inspired by Kpop. It incorporates keywords and concepts from the world of Kpop to create a unique and fun coding experience.


## Features


Easy-to-learn syntax inspired by Kpop keywords and concepts
Variable assignment using the "release" keyword, with values set by chart rankings
Code comments using the "reaction" keyword
Output text using the "radio" keyword
Variable deletion using the "n(o)onc" keyword
And more!


## Getting Started
1. install KICL interpreter. ( It will have both online and offline)
2. Write KICL code using the interpreter.

## Examples
Here's an example of some KICL code that prints out a message to the console:
```on_stage
    release message in "Hello, K-pop listeners!"
    radio message
encore
```

### Note

KICL is currently in development and is not yet released. The code examples and features mentioned in this README file are subject to change. This is a work in progress and we appreciate your patience as we continue to develop the language.

Note that an online and offline interpreter will be made available in the future.
